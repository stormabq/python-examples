This example contains all of the indicators that only have close as
the input parameter and nothing else.  So if you search in the doc for

```
close (pandas.Series) – dataset ‘Close’ column.
```

this example only has this one parameter.  All of the other
indicators have more than one input parameter.  You will note
that the signature for all of these indicators is exactly the
same except for the function name.
